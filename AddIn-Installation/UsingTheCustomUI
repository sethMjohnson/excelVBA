You'll need to add something to the effect of:
<Relationship Id="customUIRelID" Type="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/relationships/ui/extensibility" Target="customUI/customUI.xml"/>
To the .rels file in the _rels folder in the xml

You'll then need the file that that relationship is pointing to. In this case, "customUI.xml" inside a folder called "customUI" in the root of the document.
